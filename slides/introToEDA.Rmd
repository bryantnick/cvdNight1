## Needed R Packages - Before We Start

You will need R and Rstudio to run this workshop.

You will need the following packages to do this workshop. Please install these packages using the `install.packages()` command.

```{r message=FALSE}
#To install these packages: use install.packages("tidyverse", "shiny", "ggplot2")

library(dplyr)
library(shiny)
library(ggplot2)
```

## Overview For Today

- Mini Lecture (~ 30 min)
    - What is EDA?
    - Basics of dplyr
    - Using Shiny for EDA
- Workshop: Exploring the CVD dataset
- Discussion/Wrapup (~ 30 min)
    - What did you learn?

## What is Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)?

- Pioneered by Tukey
- Detective work on your data
- An attitude towards data, not just techniques
- 'Find patterns, reveal structure, and make tenative model assessments (Behrens)'

## Remember

"Statistical ability, divorced from a scientific intimacy with the fundamental observations, leads nowhere"
- E.G. Boring, *Mathematical vs. scientific significance*

"Exploratory data analysis can never be the whole story, but nothing else can serve as the foundation stone."
- John Tukey, *Exploratory Data Analysis*

## EDA is not cheating!

In contrast to *Confirmatory Data Analysis (CDA)*, such as hypothesis testing, the goals of EDA are to:

- Explore qualities of the dataset
- Assess whether assumptions are met for statistical models
- Filter and clean data if necessary
- Transform data into more usable format
- Make data ready for CDA

EDA is vital when repurposing and reusing data that was collected for another purpose. Don't go in blind!

## Analysis Plan

- All EDA is done in the context of an Analysis Plan
- Data is collected
- Data dictionary exists
- Be prepared to change analysis plan based on your results
    - Raise red flags on problematic data

## Role of EDA in workflow

EDA is often an iterative process. Updating your analysis plan may be necessary.

Oftentimes, new problems pop up after you solve one. Expect to go through multiple steps.

Similarly, tackle one issue at a time. Don't rush!

## EDA: Always read the data dictionary!

Always read the data dictionary if provided! There is often some useful information in there about how the data is represented (such as the units for each column, etc).

![Data Dictionary Example](image/dataDictionary.png)

## R Tools for EDA

- `head()` - Always make sure data is loaded correctly!
- `summary()` - Look for 'strange' values
- `table()` - Look for confounding among categorical variables
- `hist()` - Highlight outliers
- `boxplot()` - Compare conditional medians and distributions
- `plot.xy()` - Look for correlations among continuous variables

Not covered here, but also useful (covered in discussion):

- `pca()` - dimensionality reduction to understand variabilty in data
- `heatmap()` - cluster data to look for groupings in data

## R EDA Tools: `head()`

Sometimes, data is given in a format that has some quirks - always make sure the data is loaded correctly!

- Does file have header or not?
- Does file have quotes?

```{r}
data(iris)
head(iris)
```

For Rstudio users, `View()` is an extremely useful way to explore smaller datasets (spreadsheet like view of data)

```{r eval=FALSE}
View(iris)
```

## R EDA Tools: `summary()`

`summary()` gives a high-level view of data

- Continuous Data: Range of data
- Categorical Data: What categories exist in data, how are they distributed?
- Missing values: are covariates missing data?

```{r}
summary(iris)
```

## R EDA: `table()`

If your data contains many categorial variables, you need to check for possible confounding between them.

Examples:

- Data collected by multiple clinics, each assigned to treatment/control
- Samples processed by different labs

```{r}
data <- read.delim("data/confounding.txt")

table(data)
```

## R EDA: Histograms and Boxplots

Boxplots and histograms can highlight outliers and potential nonsensical values, especially if they are conditioned on categorical variables. 

They can also highlight how normally distributed the data is (important to see if data is satisfying assumptions).

```{r message=FALSE}
data(iris)
library(ggplot2)

#normal histogram
ggplot(iris, aes(x=Sepal.Length)) + geom_histogram()

#use facet_wrap() to condition the plot
ggplot(iris, aes(x=Sepal.Length)) + geom_histogram() + facet_wrap(c("Species"))

#show boxplot, using Species as an x variable
ggplot(iris, aes(x=Species,y=Sepal.Length)) + geom_boxplot()
```

## R EDA: X-Y plots

Highlight correlation between continuous variables. Can be really important when you are building linear models and selecting variables.

```{r}
#xy plot between Sepal.Width and Sepal.Length
ggplot(iris, aes(x=Sepal.Width, y=Sepal.Length)) + geom_point()

#show a pairs() plot
pairs(iris[,1:4])
```

## Filtering Dataset: dplyr package

While conducting your EDA, you may want to filter out data and recalculate values and assesss the impact of these statements. I will show some basics to use the `dplyr` package to do this. It's a package made for manipulating data.frames, which comes in handy.

dplyr has lots of commands, but I will just show three commands:

- `filter()` - remove rows according to criteria
- `select()` - select columns by name
- `mutate()` - calculate new column variables by manipulating data

## dplyr::filter()

`filter()` lets you select rows according to a criteria. You can use `|` (OR) and `&` (AND) to chain together logical statements.

```{r message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
newIris <- iris %>% filter(Species == "setosa" & Sepal.Length > 5)

head(newIris)
```

Note that any statement or function that produces a boolean vector (such as `is.na(Species)`) can be used here.

## dplyr::select()

`select()` lets you select columns in your dataset.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
newIris <- iris %>% select(Sepal.Width, Species)

head(newIris)
```

## dplyr::mutate()

`mutate()` is one of the most useful dplyr commands. You can use it to transform data and add it as a new column into the data.frame

```{r}
library(dplyr)
newIris <- iris %>% mutate(sepalSum = Sepal.Length + Sepal.Width)

head(newIris)

#add a column with the same value for each entry
newIris <- newIris %>% mutate(value = "Site1")

head(newIris)
```

## Chaining dplyr commands using `%>%`

The power of dplyr comes from the fact that you can chain multiple steps.

Example: Let's calculate a new column `SepalMean` on `iris` and filter the dataset on this new variable.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
data(iris)

iris2 <- iris %>% mutate(SepalMean = (Sepal.Length + Sepal.Width) / 2) %>%
  filter(SepalMean > 4)

nrow(iris)
nrow(iris2)

head(iris2)
```

## What is Shiny?

Shiny is a web presentation framework that allows you to take R code and make it into an interactive visualization. 

We'll use it for the workshop today to do our EDA.

## Running a Shiny App

You can use `runApp()` if your working directory is the same as the app, but I usually just use the `runApp` button in the corner of the Rstudio window when I am editing `global.R`, `ui.R`, or `server.R`.

![Running the shiny app](image/runningShinyApps.png)

## Using the EDA Shiny App

For the workshop, you'll use the Shiny App to do some EDA. You will need to be familiar with the basic architecture of the app.

- `global.R` - This is where you'll do the majority of the work - place filtering and processing steps here. Any objects loaded here can be seen by both the `ui.R` and `server.R`.
- `ui.R` - This is where the user interface and display elements are. Communicates with `server.R` with `input` object (values from ui Elements). Gets output elements with the `output` object provided by `server.R`.
- `server.R` - All of the actual processing and plotting goes here. Gets UI values from `input` object and places the elements to be plotted in the `output` object so `ui.R` can access it.

## The Problem

You are given a dataset that consists of patients who have an elevated cardiovascular risk. 

1) Your goal is to conduct EDA on the patient data to assess what variables are predictive of cardiovascular disease in the patient population. If you notice any issues in the data, will you need to filter or transform the data?
2) Advanced Students: Look at both the clinical and genetic covariates using EDA? What variables do you believer are predictive of CVD?

Go as far as you can. Remember to use your post-its to show your status and whether you need help.

## Go For It!

EDA is a puzzle with real-world consequences. Use your tools to understand the data!

Get the workshop materials here:

```{r eval=FALSE}
git clone http://github.com/laderast/cvdWorkshop
```

in the `cvdWorkshop/` folder, open up the `.Rproj` file

Datasets are in the `data/` folder along with the data dictionaries and readmes. 

Read `weightLossAssignment.pdf` for more details.


## Review Results of EDA Here

Results? Conclusions about the data?

For each issue with the data:
