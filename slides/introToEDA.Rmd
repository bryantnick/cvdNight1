## Needed R Packages - Before We Start

You will need R and Rstudio to run this workshop.

You will need the following packages to do this workshop. Please install these packages using the `install.packages()` command.

```{r message=FALSE}
#To install these packages: use the command
#install.packages("tidyverse", "shiny", "ggplot2")

library(dplyr)
library(shiny)
library(ggplot2)
library(data.table)

dataset <- fread("../data/fullPatientData.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

## Overview

- Mini Lecture (~ 15 min)
    - Using Shiny for EDA
    - Cleaning your dataset
- Workshop: Exploring the CVD dataset (30 min)
- Discussion/Wrapup (~ 15 min)
    - What did you learn?
    
## The Dataset

You are given a dataset that consists of patients who have been assessed for cardiovascular disease (CVD). 

Your goal for today is to explore the dataset and identify a subgroup that is at risk for CVD.

Tomorrow, we'll attempt to use machine learning to build a model to predict risk in another set of patients.

## What is Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)?

- Pioneered by Tukey
- Detective work on your data
- An attitude towards data, not just techniques
- 'Find patterns, reveal structure, and make tenative model assessments (Behrens)'

## EDA is not cheating!

In contrast to *Confirmatory Data Analysis (CDA)*, such as hypothesis testing, the goals of EDA are to:

- Explore qualities of the dataset
- Assess whether assumptions are met for statistical models
- Filter and clean data if necessary
- Transform data into more usable format
- Make data ready for CDA

EDA is vital when repurposing and reusing data that was collected for another purpose. Don't go in blind!

## Analysis Plan

- All EDA is done in the context of an Analysis Plan
- Data is collected
- Data dictionary exists
- Be prepared to change analysis plan based on your results
    - Raise red flags on problematic data

## EDA: Always read the data dictionary!

Always read the data dictionary if provided! There is often some useful information in there about how the data is represented (such as the units for each column, etc).

## R EDA Tools: `head()`

Sometimes, data is given in a format that has some quirks - always make sure the data is loaded correctly!

- Does the file have a header or not?
- Does the file have quotes?

```{r}
data(iris)
head(iris)
```

For Rstudio users, `View()` is an extremely useful way to explore smaller datasets (spreadsheet like view of data)

```{r eval=FALSE}
View(iris)
```

## What is Shiny?

Shiny is a framework that allows you to take R code and make it into an interactive visualization. 

We'll use it for the workshop today to do our EDA.

## Using the EDA Shiny App

For the workshop, you'll use the Shiny App to do some EDA. You will need to be familiar with the basic architecture of the app.

- `global.R` - This is where you'll do the majority of the work - place filtering and processing steps here. Any objects loaded here can be seen by both the `ui.R` and `server.R`.

## Running a Shiny App

You can use `runApp()` if your working directory is the same as the app, but I usually just use the `runApp` button in the corner of the Rstudio window when I am editing `global.R`.

## What can the explorer do?:

Ideally, even with EDA, we have some ideas of aspects of the data to explore before we get started. I'll show how:

1.  Summary Tables (What categories exist in the data?)
2.  Cross-tables (How does age influence CVD risk?)
3.  Histograms (How is age distibuted in our population?)
4.  Boxplots (How is CVD)

## Questions for you to answer

Using the Shiny App:

 + How many people have CVD?
 + What are the biggest contributors to 10 year CVD risk?
 + Which groups have elevated CVD risk?
  + define by age, gender, race
 + How does genetics influence CVD risk?
 
## Your Goal for Today

Given the larger dataset, identify a group you believe is at elevated risk for CVD.

Use no more than two filtering criteria (Race + Age, Gender + Smoking, etc) to define your group. 

Why is your group interesting to you? How big is your group?

We'll see how well we can predict CVD risk for your group tomorrow.

## Filtering Dataset: dplyr package

We'll use the `dplyr` package to filter and identify our subgroup of interest.

`dplyr` has lots of commands, but I will just show one command today: 

- `filter()` - remove rows according to criteria

## dplyr::filter()

`filter()` lets you select rows according to a criteria. You can use `|` (OR) and `&` (AND) to chain together logical statements.

```{r message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)

newData <- dataset %>% filter(gender=="M")

knitr::kable(head(newData))
```

We'll use the `filter()` verb to subset the data so we can examine questions about these subsets.

For advanced students: Note that any statement or function that produces a boolean vector (such as `is.na(Species)`) can be used here.

## Go For It!

EDA is a puzzle with real-world consequences. Use your tools to understand the data!

Get the workshop materials here:

```{r eval=FALSE}
git clone http://github.com/laderast/cvdWorkshop
```

in the `cvdWorkshop/` folder, open up the `.Rproj` file

Datasets are in the `data/` folder along with the data dictionaries and readmes. The Shiny app should automatically load the data when you run it.

To make modifications to the data, you'll need to modify the global.R file.

Read `cvdWorkshopNight1.pdf` for more details.

## Review Results of EDA Here

Results? Conclusions about the data?

For each issue with the data: 

- What was the issue?
- What did you decide to do about it?
- What was the impact of your action?
